# Vayo Vault - Hosting & Deployment Strategy

## Primary Hosting Platform: Vercel

### Rationale for Vercel Selection

Based on comprehensive hosting analysis, **Vercel** is the optimal choice for Vayo Vault's launch and scale:

#### Performance Advantages
- **Next.js Native Optimization**: Built by Next.js creators, ensuring optimal performance
- **Edge Network**: 40+ global regions for <1s worldwide response times
- **Build Caching**: Incremental builds reduce deployment time from 15min to 3min
- **Core Web Vitals**: Optimized for LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1 targets

#### Business Alignment
- **Subscription Model Support**: Seamless Stripe integration for $37/month billing
- **Traffic Scaling**: Handles launch target of 10k concurrent users
- **Growth Ready**: Auto-scaling to 100k concurrent users within 12 months
- **Global Audience**: CDN optimization for primary US market with global expansion

#### Developer Experience
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic deployments on push
- **Preview Deployments**: Branch previews for stakeholder review
- **Environment Management**: Seamless dev/staging/production parity
- **Monitoring**: Built-in analytics and performance tracking

### Alternative Platforms Considered

#### Cloudflare Pages - Secondary Option
- **Pros**: Fastest global CDN, lowest cost, DDoS protection
- **Cons**: Less mature Next.js integration, limited serverless functions
- **Use Case**: Considered for static assets CDN in hybrid approach

#### Netlify - Rejected for Scale
- **Pros**: Good developer experience, competitive pricing initially
- **Cons**: Usage-based pricing becomes expensive at scale, build performance limitations
- **Decision**: Not suitable for projected growth trajectory
