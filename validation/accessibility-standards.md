## Overview
This document outlines the accessibility requirements for Vayo Vault to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, making our travel membership platform usable by everyone, including users with disabilities.

## Four Fundamental Principles

### 1. Perceivable - Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive

#### Color and Contrast
- [ ] **Color contrast ratio minimum 4.5:1** for normal text (18pt and under)
- [ ] **Color contrast ratio minimum 3:1** for large text (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold)
- [ ] **Color contrast ratio minimum 3:1** for UI components and graphics
- [ ] Information not conveyed by color alone (use icons, text, patterns)
- [ ] Focus indicators have minimum 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colors

#### Text and Typography
- [ ] Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of functionality
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling when text is enlarged to 200%

### 2. Operable - Interface components must be operable
